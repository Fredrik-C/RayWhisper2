# RayWhisper Example Configuration
# Copy this file to config.yaml and adjust values as needed

# Audio Configuration
audio:
  sample_rate: 16000        # Hz
  channels: 1               # Mono
  chunk_duration: 0.1       # seconds

# Whisper Model Configuration
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: GPU acceleration requires CUDA 12 and cuDNN 9 with a compatible NVIDIA GPU
# If you don't have CUDA 12/cuDNN 9, use: device: "cpu" and compute_type: "int8"
whisper:
  model_size: "base"        # Standard sizes: tiny, base, small, medium, large-v2, large-v3, distil-large-v3
                            # Or HuggingFace model ID: Systran/faster-whisper-medium.en, Systran/faster-whisper-large-v3, etc.
  device: "cpu"             # cpu, cuda, auto (use "cpu" if you don't have CUDA 12/cuDNN 9)
  compute_type: "int8"      # int8 (fastest on CPU), int8_float16 (for GPU), float16, float32
  language: null            # null for auto-detect, or "en", "es", etc.

# GPU Configuration (requires CUDA 12 + cuDNN 9):
#   device: "cuda"
#   compute_type: "int8_float16"
#
# CPU Configuration (no CUDA required):
#   device: "cpu"
#   compute_type: "int8"

# Vector Database Configuration
vector_db:
  collection_name: "raywhisper_docs"
  embedding_model: "BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5"   # default; consider BAAI/bge-m3 for multilingual/long-docs
  persist_directory: "./data/chroma"
  top_k: 5                  # Number of results to retrieve
  chunk_size: 3             # Number of words per chunk (2-5 recommended for keyword/phrase matching)
  chunk_overlap: 2          # Number of overlapping words between chunks
  use_query_instruction: false  # Use instruction prefix for queries (false for keyword-based search)

# Reranker Configuration
reranker:
  model_name: "BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3"     # alternative: jinaai/jina-reranker-v2-base-multilingual (non-commercial)
  top_n: 3                  # Number of results after reranking

# Keyboard Configuration
# Key hold hotkey to start recording (hold to record, release to transcribe)
# For Windows: use "super+o" for Windows key + comma
keyboard:
  start_stop_hotkey: "super+o"
  cancel_hotkey: "ctrl+shift+esc"

# Output Configuration
output:
  typing_speed: 0.01        # Delay between keystrokes (seconds)
  use_clipboard_fallback: false
