## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of information retrieval systems with generative AI models. By augmenting language models with retrieved relevant documents, RAG systems provide more accurate, contextually grounded, and factually reliable responses while reducing hallucinations.
